Everything below is stream-of-conciousness from developing under a pre-1.0 rust
in a custom linux environment (arbux):

* bundled version of curl or w/e doesn't properly SSL (probably arbux issue)
* no ntohs? really?
* missing / moving things
* error handling, erm?
* error handling, wtf (println! while debugging via output generates signal 4)
* llvm toolchain instead of gnu (no lldb, no libs for codegen on arbux)

* combined pointers?
/data/many-flow.pcap1.pcap: No such file or directory
let input = pcap::read("/data/many-flow.pcap");
let output = pcap::write("1.pcap", input.datalink(), input.snaplen());

* two string types (fmurphy-- RTFM)
* scoping and other such problems
* no concurrent dictionary in stdlib
* no impl of Serializable, PartialEq for AtomicUsize
* confusion between std::fs, std::io::fs etc (see missing/moving things)
